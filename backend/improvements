# note proposed improvements to backend

- validate inputs from URIs. For instance, validate that a review ID caught in
  the route actually belongs to the signed-in customer.

- set reviews.total_votes to a default (5) in the model. Should improve
performance if the app grows big, and, thus, handles a huge volume of requests.

- validate/escape user inputs to be saved to database (e.g. reviews)

- view_histories table for recording service pages viewed by customers.
