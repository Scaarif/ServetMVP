####--GENERAL CONSTRAINTS--####
- all service categories are to be pre-populated in the database by the developers, at the moment

- all countries are to be pre-populated in the database by the developers, at the moment

- all states are to be pre-populated in the database by the developers, at the moment

- all locations are to be pre-populated in the database by the developers, at the moment

- in other words, for the time being (pending a better implementation), the database has to be aware of all service provider, country, state, and location records before the users select them in the frontend.
