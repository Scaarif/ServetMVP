Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. Creating a graph in Vue.js can be achieved using various third-party libraries. One of the most popular libraries for creating graphs and charts is Chart.js.

Here are the steps to create a graph in Vue.js using Chart.js:

### Install Chart.js library using npm command:
```sh
npm install chart.js --save
```
### Import the library in your Vue.js component:
```js
import Chart from 'chart.js';
```
### Create a canvas element in your template where the graph will be displayed:
```html
<canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
```
In the component's mounted hook, create a new instance of the Chart.js library and pass in the canvas element and the configuration options for your graph:
```js
mounted() {
    const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
    const myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
        type: 'bar',
        data: {
            labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July'],
            datasets: [{
                label: 'Sales',
                data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3, 15],
                backgroundColor: [
                    'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)'
                ],
                borderColor: [
                    'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                    'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                    'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                    'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                    'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                    'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
                ],
                borderWidth: 1
            }]
        },
        options: {
            scales: {
                yAxes: [{
                    ticks: {
                        beginAtZero: true
                    }
                }]
            }
        }
    });
}
```
The data and options properties of the myChart object passed to the Chart.js constructor determine the chart's appearance and behavior.

In this example, we've created a bar chart with data for monthly sales, with labels for each month and corresponding data points.

The backgroundColor and borderColor properties determine the color of the bars, while the borderWidth property sets the width of the borders around the bars.

The options property contains settings for the chart's scales, including the y-axis tick values.

That's it! You should now be able to see a bar chart in your Vue.js application. You can customize the chart further by modifying the data and options properties as per your requirements.

## Line graph
steps are the same except the following bit:
```js
const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
    const myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
        type: 'line',
        data: {
            labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July'],
            datasets: [{
                label: 'Sales',
                data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3, 15],
                fill: false,
                borderColor: 'rgb(75, 192, 192)',
                tension: 0.1
            }]
        },
        options: {
            scales: {
                yAxes: [{
                    ticks: {
                        beginAtZero: true
                    }
                }]
            }
        }
    });
}
```
The data and options properties of the myChart object passed to the Chart.js constructor determine the chart's appearance and behavior.

In this example, we've created a line chart with data for monthly sales, with labels for each month and corresponding data points.

The fill property is set to false to disable filling the area under the line.

The borderColor property determines the color of the line, while the tension property sets the tension of the curve between the data points.

The options property contains settings for the chart's scales, including the y-axis tick values.

That's it! You should now be able to see a line chart in your Vue.js application. You can customize the chart further by modifying the data and options properties as per your requirements.
