# Servet
### The market place for services

![image](https://ibb.co/yFrwGx4) 

Servet is a web application built by [Rahab](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-rahab/) and [Greenbel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greenbele/) for service providers and seekers to connect. The idea behind its conception was that seekers of handy services such as hairdressing, plumbing, electrical and related services be able to quickly browse through services in the category they seek and available in their neighborhood and get the provider's contact, all in a few clicks. The end product is [Servet](https://github.io/Scaarif/ServetMVP/).

You can read more about **Servet**: the inspiration, challenges, lessons, hacks and general development process in the form of developers' reflections in the linked blogs below:
- [Frontend - Rahab](https:rahab_blog)
- [Backend - Greenbel](https:greenbel_blog)

## Project installation
To be able to run and test the project yourself, clone the repository and run the following commands:
- ### Backend (Flask app)
[~~To be added~~]

- ### Frontend (Vue app)
From inside the just cloned repository, ensure you have _node_ and _npm_ installed then:
```sh 
cd servetMVP

```
install the application's dependencies as in the dependencies file [package.json](https:github_link_to_file)
```sh 
npm install or npm i
```
then run the application
```sh 
npm run dev
```
**NOTE:** the application relies on the backend application for data. For the application to properly function, ensure the backend (_flask app_) application is already up and running by following the **steps described above**

## Usage
Once you've run the **frontend application** as described above, follow/open the application's domain link in your favorite browser. Then, the most important step - **_interact with the application_** :) Simple, right?

## Major Features
Some of the implemented features include:

- ### Browse/Filter Services
Filter services by category and location to get exactly the service you need and in your preferred location.
- ### Investigate a service
Investigate a specific service by reading through what other customers/seekers have to say about the service and go for the best possible
- ### Rate a service
Help other seekers get the best service possible by reviewing it (rating and commenting on it) once you've consumed said service.
- ### Post a service
Are you a service provider? Post the service(s) you offer and make them all the more accessible.
- ### Update a service
Make any necessary changes to a service (for service providers) to make them more accessible or attractive to clients.

## Contributing
While [Rahab](https://github.com/scaarif) worked on most of the frontend (_Vue app_) while [Greenbel](https://github.com/Coldplayz) worked on most of the backend (_Flask app_), both parties contributed to the other application's development in different capacities - whether it was debugging, brainstorming on approaches and in suggesting solutions.
