            <div class="story">
                <p>Turns out sometimes getting the usually 'trivial' services - re-twisting my hair for instance - can be a hustle,
                    especially when one's only recently moved into an area. I've had people literally stop me on the road and ask where they can find dreadlocks salons (I wear those :).
                    Has your sink ever blocked and for some reason your building's caretaker is unavailable? It takes forever to find some of these services providers ...
                    But there's social media, right? I don't have the time to search through all that 'clutter'... No offense... 
                    With Servet, finding the service I need is literally a click (well, selection) away... </p>
