            <div class="story">
                <p>Turns out otherwise 'trivial' task of getting handy services - re-twisting my hair for instance - can be a hustle,
                    especially when one's only recently moved into an area. I've had people literally stop me on the road and ask where they can find dreadlocks salons (I wear those :).
                    Too far fetched? Ok, this one might hit closer home - has your sink ever blocked and for some reason your building's caretaker is unavailable? It takes forever to find some of these services providers ...
                    But there's social media, right? But I don't have the time to search through all that 'clutter'... No offense... 
                    With Servet, finding the service I need is literally a click (well, selection) away... </p>
